# AI YouTube Shorts Generator

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that automatically generates viral YouTube Shorts from long-form YouTube videos using AI-powered content analysis. The system downloads YouTube videos, transcribes them, analyzes the content with Google's Gemini AI to identify viral potential, and creates short vertical clips optimized for social media.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask web application with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (default) with support for PostgreSQL via environment configuration
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 integration for YouTube API access
- **Processing Pipeline**: Asynchronous video processing with threading
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for content analysis and viral potential scoring

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5 dark theme
- **UI Components**: Responsive design with progress tracking and real-time updates
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS for form validation and UI interactions
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Bootstrap integration

## Key Components

### Core Models
- **VideoJob**: Tracks video processing status and metadata
- **VideoShort**: Stores generated short clips with engagement scores
- **TranscriptSegment**: Manages transcribed text segments
- **YouTubeCredentials**: Handles OAuth tokens for YouTube API

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Video Download**: Uses yt-dlp to fetch high-quality video content
2. **Audio Transcription**: FFmpeg-based audio processing (Whisper integration planned)
3. **Content Analysis**: Gemini AI analyzes segments for viral potential
4. **Video Editing**: MoviePy-based clip generation with aspect ratio conversion
5. **YouTube Upload**: Automated upload to user's YouTube channel

### External Services Integration
- **YouTube Data API v3**: For video upload and metadata management
- **Google Gemini AI**: For content analysis and viral scoring
- **OAuth 2.0**: For secure YouTube account authentication

## Data Flow

1. User submits YouTube URL via web interface
2. System validates URL and creates VideoJob record
3. Background processor downloads video using yt-dlp
4. Audio is extracted and transcribed (mock implementation currently)
5. Transcript segments are analyzed by Gemini AI for engagement scores
6. High-scoring segments are edited into vertical short clips
7. Generated shorts are stored and optionally uploaded to YouTube

## External Dependencies

### Required API Keys
- **GEMINI_API_KEY**: Google Gemini AI for content analysis
- **YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID**: OAuth client ID for YouTube API
- **YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET**: OAuth client secret for YouTube API

### Python Packages
- Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy for web framework
- yt-dlp for YouTube video downloading
- MoviePy for video editing and processing
- Google AI client libraries for Gemini integration
- Google API client for YouTube upload functionality

### System Dependencies
- FFmpeg for audio/video processing
- SQLite database (default) or PostgreSQL

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- Supports both local development and Replit hosting
- Dynamic redirect URI configuration based on REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN
- Environment-based database URL configuration
- Secure session management with configurable secret keys

### File Structure
- `uploads/`: Temporary storage for downloaded videos
- `outputs/`: Generated short clips storage
- `temp/`: Temporary processing files
- `templates/`: Jinja2 HTML templates
- `static/`: CSS, JavaScript, and static assets

### Database Schema
- Automatic table creation on application startup
- Enum-based status tracking for processing stages
- JSON fields for flexible metadata storage
- Timestamp tracking for all operations
